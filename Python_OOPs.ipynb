        "\n",
        "Its main purpose is to allow for cleanup actions before the object is removed from memory, such as closing open files, releasing network connections, or freeing up system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is useful in scenarios where an object manages external resources that need to be explicitly released.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, relying on __del__ is generally discouraged because the timing of its execution is not guaranteed—especially in cases involving circular references or in some Python implementations like PyPy. A more reliable approach for resource management is to use context managers (with statements) with __enter__ and __exit__ methods.\n",
